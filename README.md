# lyft

This repository contains code for the Technical Sample portion of the Lyft Software Apprentice application.  
My small web application is written in Flask/Python.

To run, clone the repository, and then run the command `./lyft` in one terminal window. In another terminal window, run the command `curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/test --data '{"string_to_cut": "iamyourlyftdriver"}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json`.
